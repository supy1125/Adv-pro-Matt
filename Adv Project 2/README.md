Fitness Aids

Concept: It's a fitness-assisted device that users wear on their body and enter a goal for the day (e.g., today the user wants to burn 1,000 calories.) The IMU uses the intensity and duration of the user's workout to extrapolate the approximate number of calories the user has burned, and then displays it via an LED Strip. Red means just started, until green means the goal for the day has been achieved.
