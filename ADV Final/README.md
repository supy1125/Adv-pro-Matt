# Adv Final Project

Phone Locker

Concept: My attention is often distracted by my cell phone, so this is a cell phone sealer, when the user puts the phone on the sealer, the machine arms on both sides will automatically hold the phone in place, and the light will come on for a certain amount of time before the user can take the phone out. And the led light on the head will change according to the time.
