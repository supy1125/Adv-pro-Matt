# Adv Project 1

Play gopher

This project is made from the screen of the M5Stack and the two pieces of copper linked to it. This is a project to test the responsiveness of the user. When the user starts the game, the screen will turn red and turn green in the next 5 seconds, the user needs to stick the two pieces of copper together the moment the screen turns green, and eventually the screen will show how long it took the user to react.
