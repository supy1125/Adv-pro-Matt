# Adv Project 3

Finger Cutter

Concept: It's a small device that exercises the user's reflexes, and the Servo will have a wooden knife that will suddenly slash down over the next five seconds. The user will need to place their finger underneath the knife and pull their finger out before the knife slashes down.
